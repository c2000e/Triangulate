# Triangulate

My goal is to build an application that lets you draw points, lines, and polygons and then triangulates them.

To build it you'll need cmake installed. You can *probably* change the minimum cmake version to be a little bit lower than it is but I haven't tested it with other versions.

If you're using a mac, there's a weird issue with SDL2 where you'll need to add a point, then move the window, then add another point for everything to be displayed in the correct location.
